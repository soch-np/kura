<center><h1>Covid-19 and Bright future of Nepal?</h1></center>


<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">
<br>In context to Nepal, it’s impossible to defeat Covid-19. As the second wave of covid is hitting hard in our daily life. We might never defeat it.<br> 

<br>In Spite of  the rise of covid cases in India, our neighbouring country, we Nepalese were careless and didn’t even wear masks and didn’t care about covid cause it was believed as a myth by most of the people. Public didn’t take it very seriously and blamed the government bodies.<br> 
<br>There is no proper covid testing and the isolation wards(quarantines) for the people returning from India.<br> 

<br>Is it the fault of Citizens only? No, it's not the fault of citizens only but it's the fault of all the leaders who are in their position. However, it’s the fault of the government too.<br>  
<br>Neither the hospitals are established nor the strict rules have been implemented.<br>  
<br>As per the Prime Minister said that all the citizens will be vaccinated against covid in 3 months. Meanwhile it is said that only half of the citizens are vaccinated. In the process of buying the covid vaccination doses there was a dirty politics behind it too. The commission game was played in such vital things, which must not have been played.<br>  

<br>On the other hand, the strict lockdown must have been implemented a week before it was implemented. The government must have taken the decision according to the experts. Till today experts have warned that Nepal will  face the same situation as India faced.<br>       

<br>Similarly, The politicians were in the race to capture the chair and whom to be on top. Many people from the parts of countries were brought on capital for the mass movement. As the covid was rising in India, the health minister published notices not to gather more than 25 people, but Nepalese immune system is strong as per the Prime Minister and he inaugurated Dharahara (also known as “Jhilke Tower” by most of the people) with mass gathering which violated protocol of health minister.<br> 

<br>In addition, by following the protocols strictly and taking covid as in a serious way. No gathering in any of the formal or informal meetings. Washing hands with soap and water, sanitizing the areas which are frequently touched, cleaning the things which are used and wearing masks which are of multiple layers for the public and the government must implement strict lockdown and the isolation wards must be established in a rapid way in each and every places and mostly in all the borders.<br>  

<br>After this it is the time when everyone must think well with their mind about all the things that we faced and the reasons for all the problems we faced. As said by many people,”Nepalese are like sheep, where the crowd is there is Nepalese.”We must change these concepts that have been generated by the upper generations. We must think responsibly. We must take things seriously and then we are going to be in a phase of development. Then we can be proud of the things that we have gained through hard work and should develop them.<br>  
<br>So, basically the thing I wanted to convey was we must take the election seriously. Voting for the right candidate is the only way to come out from all these current affairs that are going on. For instance the Prime Minister of Canada(Justin Trudeau,49 years) have done very well in development of Canada and its people, and the Prime Minister of New Zealand(Jacinda Ardern,4o years) have done the same and made the country well managed. There are many other examples and we must learn from these countries and make our country developed.<br>
<br>  “Vote right, have a bright future” must be taken seriously.<br>  

<br>Finally, take the covid seriously and in the next election let’s vote for a right candidate and develop our country in each and every aspect.“Vote right, have a bright future” must be taken seriously and the voter’s must be very aware about whom to vote and whom not to. Say No to Nepotism and Favoritism.<br> 
<br>Stay Safe.<br>

<center><h1>Can the kids from Generation Z be better politician in Nepal than the present politicians?</h1></center>
<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">
What is happening now?<br>

<br>Every old politician of our country has no idea how to establish things. Why? Because it might be because they have no idea to make a decision or they don’t have an idea to generate an idea. One of the main reasons is because they don’t have a good education and As Nelson Mandela has quoted “Education is the most powerful weapon which can rule the world”, but the politician of our country has neither idea nor education. They just know how to make things done by just pretending to complete it. <br>

<br>Why is it happening?<br>

<br>In my opinion, it is because the politicians who are in power have not been trained for this from a very early age. That means the way they grow up didn’t make them the way to generate ideas.<br>

<br>For example, the kids from Generation Z have more knowledge than the politician that is in power. Why?<br>

<br>Because the kids from Generation Z have more ideas then the politician in our country. The level of the kids that are of Generation Z is more than the politician. They know what time they should collect, prepare, attack, and defend. It is because the way they grow up matters. Generation Z has been trained from their childhood days by the games they play for example Pocket Tank, Counter-Strike, Clash of clans, Mario, etc. In these games, the kids learned that they have to first collect resources, prepare for the war or some casualties, and attack or defend seeing the situation. They got the sense of being the leader of the game who has to take responsibility for any casualties in the game so they generate new ideas and try to win each and every game they play. <br>

<br>The reason why I am pointing towards the childhood days is that if a person can generate an idea then if he is used to it then he can be a great person or successful person. For example, The Captain of an E-Sports Team OG Johan Sundstein "N0tail" had been playing games since he was 15 years old and now he is one of the richest E-Sport players. He had generated his own way of playing and made a team that won the TI8 and TI9 (which is one of the prestigious tournaments for Dota 2 players.) The Total Net worth of the N0tail is $6,974,817.80 from 127 tournaments. So, he developed his own idea and made his own meta, and conquered the tournament. So, the games that you played and grew up in really matters.<br>

<br>In conclusion, I would like to say is that the way the politician thinks is very very noobie and they shouldn't follow what India or China says. They must develop their own idea and develop in each and every sector. Or they should resign and give the power to the young people's i.e Generation Z. <br>
